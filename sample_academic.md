## Background

The challenge of communicating complex ideas clearly has driven decades of research in visual design.

Key principles:
- **Clarity** over decoration
- **Hierarchy** through typography
- **Restraint** in color usage

## Prior Work

> "Good design is as little design as possible."
> — Dieter Rams

Previous approaches relied on heavy ornamentation. We propose a minimal, type-driven alternative.

## Methodology

We evaluated three design dimensions:

| Dimension | Metric | Tool |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Readability | Flesch-Kincaid | Automated |
| Visual clarity | Eye-tracking | Lab study |
| Retention | Recall test | Survey |

```python
def score(readability, clarity, retention):
    return (readability * 0.3
          + clarity * 0.4
          + retention * 0.3)
```

## Quantitative

- Readability improved by **34%**
- Visual clarity score: **8.7 / 10**
- 48-hour retention: **72%** (vs 41% baseline)

Statistical significance: *p < 0.001*

::right::

## Qualitative

Participants noted:

- "Clean and easy to follow"
- "The type hierarchy guided my attention"
- "Colors felt intentional, not distracting"
